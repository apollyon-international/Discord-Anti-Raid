### Apollyon International
is a Anti-Raiding Service and Organization dedicated to bringing continuosly harassed and raided
users a sense of relief and satisfaction after endless suffering at the hands of raiders.
Our Anti-Raid software will handle any and all incursions onto your user bases, servers, and more.

No more destructive bot waves.

No more user selfbots.

No more spammers and advertisers.

We prevent raiders from joining in the first place, and loopholes are handled by an external service.
In addition, we raid servers and user bases of known and confirmed raiders, ourselves and with our partners and donors,
to end the problem at the source.
Say no more to ceaseless nuisance.
Say hello to Apollyon International Raiding Services.
